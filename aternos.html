        <h2>Why the Server Isn't Always On 24/7</h2>
        <p>The OUTCAST SMP server is hosted on Aternos, a free Minecraft server hosting platform. Aternos provides free server hosting services to Minecraft players through sponsorships and donations.</p>
        <p>However, due to the nature of free hosting services, the server may not be available 24/7. Aternos relies on sponsorships to cover the costs of server infrastructure, and this may lead to occasional downtimes or limitations on server uptime.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Aternos will automatically shut down servers with no active players, requiring the server to be manually powered back on. This is intentional, as it keeps inactive servers from using too many resources on Aternos's backend services, and therefore mitigates server lag.</p>
        <p>We appreciate your understanding and support as we utilize Aternos to provide a free Minecraft server experience for our community.</p>

        <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
