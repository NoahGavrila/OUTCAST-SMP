        <h2>Why the Server Isn't Always On 24/7</h2>
        <p>The OUTCAST SMP server is hosted on Aternos, a free Minecraft server hosting platform. Aternos provides free server hosting services to Minecraft players through sponsorships and donations.</p>
        <p>However, due to the nature of free hosting services, the server may not be available 24/7. Aternos relies on sponsorships to cover the costs of server infrastructure, and this may lead to occasional downtimes or limitations on server uptime.</p>
        <p>We appreciate your understanding and support as we utilize Aternos to provide a free Minecraft server experience for our community.</p>
